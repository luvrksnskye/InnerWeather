# InnerWeather (Alpha)

InnerWeather is a small and simple website for tracking your emotions and receiving feedback based on them. My colleagues asked me to create the basic design for this website, and I decided to do just that with a few features. This project is still in development and was just a base I was asked to create! However, feel free to experiment with it however you like.
